# Visiting the eCommerceCamp in Jena

The [eCommerceCamp](http://www.ecommerce-camp.de) is an annual [Barcamp](http://barcamp.org) that takes place in Jena, the capital of the eCommerce sphere in Germany, where a lot of the magic of online shopping started and still happens today.

As always the highly affordable tickets for the unconference – well-organised by [tritum](http://www.tritum.de/) and [marmalade](http://www.marmalade.de/) – were sold out upfront and around 300 participants from near and far were expected.

## The participants

The clientele consists mainly of UI and UX designers, frontend and backend developers, project managers and some dedicated testers from web agencies with 1 to 30 people, who typically work with self-contained content management systems like Magento, OXID, Shopware, TYPO3 or even WordPress. 

Attendees from the global eCommerce players are typically lesser represented, but this doesn't mean that local matadors like Intershop or ePages are not there as well.

## The setting

The event began with a dinner on Thursday evening in a famous local restaurant, which should break the ice of everyone's comfort zone and kickoff the communication flow.

On friday morning the session planning for both days took place. Everybody can suggest an own Open Space talk. The crowd expresses interest in a suggestion via raising their hands. This immediate reaction allows a proper planning of the time slot and room allocation for the session.

## The sessions

To give you a better impression of the actual contents of the conference I want to highlight some of the sessions I visited.

My first session was held by Christoph Rüger, who is part of a team that has built a cloud service that reads data from files (uploaded CSV, XML, Google Drive etc.) and let's the user create workflows (cronjobs with conditions and scheduling) that can interact with other service providers. In the session Christopher showed which tools his team used for internal project management and customer communication and explained the process of finding the fitting frameworks for developing their service.

The next presentation dealt with Infrastructure as Code. Jan Peschke and Manuel Dieckmann prepared a talk about how they automated the rollout and development of their environment for Shopware with OpenStack, a solution similar to Amazon AWS. Currently this technology is on the transition to production-readyness, but not there yet. However a lot of minor ISPs already emphasize it as one of their new key selling points of their customer portfolio, but actually they support it very poorly under the hood at the moment. In the session it was made clear that developers have to be very careful with their service provider choice, if they opt against rackspace. Nevertheless, OpenStack in general is very interesting, already offers a lot of features and will be worth following in the future.

Another interesting session was a guided discussion about Magento 2. Björn Jacob and Tobias Vogt explained in an entertaining fashion the new feature set in interaction with the audience. Over the whole session length, the enhancement of the productivity and performance improvement as well as the overall stability of the new major relase were questioned very often. The consolidated experience of the session room concluded that serveral good decisions werde made for example less compiler, modes (default, env, prod), stricter separation of layout and logic via templates and modules, dependency injection, service contracts, XML schema definition for configfiles. The software project has become much more open and community driven. Another finding was that version 2.1 might be able to offer a competive performance for larger shops again.

The last track on friday was offered by Andreas Ziethen, who humbly claims to be the senior apprentice at his company. In fact he is the highly likeable head of RND that flawlessly proved his comprehensive knowledge about deployment automation in front of a full room. The encouraging talk focused on the usage of GitLab for deployment and Rundeck for job scheduling and runbook automation. Today, the interplay of both technologies is already at a very mature quality level and typical tasks like staging and conditional build steps can be represented within versioned job descriptions. If you have a small project with an according set of requirements for your CI and CD pipeline setup the discussed solution might be competetive with Jenkins, Bamboo or TeamCity.
