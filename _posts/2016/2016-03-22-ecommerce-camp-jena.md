# Visiting the eCommerceCamp in Jena

The [eCommerceCamp](http://www.ecommerce-camp.de) is an annual [Barcamp](http://barcamp.org) that takes place in Jena, the capital of the eCommerce sphere in Germany, where a lot of the magic of online shopping started and still happens today.

As always the highly affordable tickets for the unconference – well-organised by [tritum](http://www.tritum.de/) and [marmalade](http://www.marmalade.de/) – were sold out upfront and around 300 participants from near and far were expected.

## The participants

The clientele consists mainly of UI and UX designers, frontend and backend developers, project managers, some marketing people and also a few dedicated testers from web agencies with 1 to 20 people, who typically work with self-contained content management systems like [Magento](https://magento.com/), [OXID](http://www.oxid-esales.com/), [Shopware](https://en.shopware.com), [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/) or even [WordPress](https://wordpress.com). 

Attendees from the global eCommerce players are typically lesser represented, but this doesn't mean that local matadors like Intershop or ePages are not there as well.

## The setting

The event began with a dinner on Thursday evening in a famous local restaurant, which should break the ice of everyone's comfort zone and kickoff the communication flow.

On friday morning the session planning for both days took place. Everybody can suggest an own Open Space talk. The crowd expresses interest in a suggestion via raising their hands. This immediate reaction allows a proper planning of the time slot and room allocation for the session.

## The sessions

To give you a better impression of the actual contents of the conference I want to outline some of the sessions. As I am a backend software craftsman you may recognise easily that I skipped the marketing and lawfully oriented parts of the event and tried to focus on the more technical talks.

The first session was held by Christoph Rüger, who is part of a small team that has built a new cloud service that reads data from files (uploaded CSV, XML, Google Drive etc.) and let's the user create workflows via Drag'n'Drop (e.g. cronjobs with conditions and scheduling) that can interact with other service providers. Christopher revealed which tools his team used for internal project management and customer communication. He also explained the process of finding the fitting frameworks for developing their service, which was a quite interesting to follow.

The next presentation dealt with the topic "Infrastructure as Code". Jan Peschke and Manuel Dieckmann prepared a talk about how they automated the rollout and development of their shop environment with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), a solution similar to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). Currently this cloud technology is on the transition to the state of production-readyness but not there yet. However a lot of minor service providers already emphasize OpenStack in the marketing ads as one of their new offers of the customer portfolio. In the session it was made clear that developers have to be very careful with such their announcements as the promises of most service provider can be very disappointing and do not hold up to a valid support of OpenStack. So be careful, if you opt against rackspace. Nevertheless, OpenStack in general is very interesting, already offers a lot of features and will be worth following in the future.

Another interesting session was a guided discussion about [Magento 2](https://magento.com/developers/magento2). Björn Jacob and Tobias Vogt explained in an entertaining fashion the new feature set in frequent interplay with the strongly involved audience. Over the whole session length, the enhancement of the productivity and performance improvement as well as the overall stability of the new major relase were questioned very often. The consolidated experience of the session room concluded that serveral good decisions werde made for example less compiler, modes (default, env, prod), stricter separation of layout and logic via templates and modules, dependency injection, service contracts, XML schema definition for configfiles. The software project has become much more open and community driven. Another finding was that version 2.1 might be able to offer a competive performance for larger shops again.

The last track on friday was offered by Andreas Ziethen, who humbly claims to be the senior apprentice at his company. In fact he is the highly likeable head of RND that flawlessly proved his comprehensive knowledge about deployment automation in front of a full room. The encouraging talk focused on the usage of GitLab for deployment and Rundeck for job scheduling and runbook automation. Today, the interplay of both technologies is already at a very mature quality level and typical tasks like staging and conditional build steps can be represented within versioned job descriptions. If you have a small project with an according set of requirements for your CI and CD pipeline setup the discussed solution might be competetive with Jenkins, Bamboo or TeamCity.
